    Summary
    HADDOCK clustered 129 structures in 12 cluster(s), which represents 64.5 % of the water-refined models HADDOCK generated. Note that currently the maximum number of models considered for clustering is 200.
    The statistics of the top 10 clusters are shown below. The top cluster is the most reliable according to HADDOCK. Its Z-score indicates how many standard deviations from the average this cluster is located in terms of score (the more negative the better). 
    A graphical representation of the results is also provided at the bottom of the page.
